    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      A little about me! My name is Abel Mengstu and I am a cashier at Walgreens
      Pharmacy. I am studying data analytics and database at Seattle central
      college, and plan to change my carrier to IT. I enjoy using my basic
      skills to contribute to my study and technological knowledge I get every
      day. My philosophy is ,every skill has a room in the world and learn
      something from your daily life. As a cashier in downtown, I am the last
      face and sometimes the only face the customer sees, I will have to answer
      questions, explain store policy, and cope with customers irritated by long
      lines or other issues, all while maintaining a friendly, professional
      manner. For serious problems, I will probably be able to call a manager or
      customer service representative. Especially working in Downtown Seattle is
      not easy but changing all the challenges we face every day every moment to
      the positive side of life and learning out it. It is a big and lifetime
      asset for me working in downtown! I always tell myself if I can do this, I
      can do anything anywhere else. After completing my study, I need to become
      front end web developer. Front end web developer plays an active role in
      the business’s key website development. He oversees frontend development
      for the business’s websites and platforms by building sitemaps,
      prototypes, wire frames, and conducting the documentation that articulates
      the sites’ structures and organization. I am learning all the required
      skills to implement any requested template, JavaScript, and CSS. Beside my
      professional skills I get from my studies my communication Skills,
      interpersonal Skills, people Skills and technology/Software knowldge are
      assets that I have.
